# Content Management System

## Problem Statement & Description
### Project Statement
The project aims to solve the problem of inefficient content creation, organization, 
collaboration, and publishing. Organizations and individuals often struggle due to the lack of a centralized 
platform, leading to scattered content, inconsistent formatting, and difficulties with collaboration. 
This results in delays, miscommunication, and poor content quality. This project proposes building a 
comprehensive content management system (CMS) to address these issues.
### Description
The CMS will provide users with a single platform to efficiently create, organize, collaborate on, and publish digital content, like pictures, text, and videos. It will streamline the content creation process, enhance teamwork, and improve version control, ultimately leading to higher-quality content and a more efficient workflow.

- The system will support multiple user roles: administrators, reviewers, and contributors.
    - Administrators can manage user roles, give out tasks, and publish content to various platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter).
    - Contributors can upload, organize, and create content, sending it to reviewers for approval.
    - Reviewers can provide feedback, make changes, and approve content for publication.

- Admins create tasks and assign a contributor to create the content. Contributors create the content and send them to reviewers to get reviewed. Reviewers will review the task and if the task is satisfactory they send it to admins to get published if not they send it back to the contributor with feedback. And the cycle continues like that.
