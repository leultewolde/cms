# Content Management System

## Problem Statement & Description
The project aims to solve the problem of inefficient content creation, organization, and publishing. Organizations and individuals often struggle with this due to the lack of a centralized platform. This can lead to scattered content, inconsistent formatting, and difficulties with collaboration and version control. As a result, there can be delays, miscommunication, and poor content quality. To fix these issues, this project proposes building a content management system (CMS).

This CMS will provide users with a single platform to efficiently upload, organize, and publish digital content, which can be a picture, text, or video. It will improve the content creation process, teamwork, and version control. This will ultimately lead to higher-quality content and a more efficient workflow. The system will have three types of users: administrators, reviewers, and contributors. Administrators assign or remove users from their roles, assign tasks to contributors, and publish the final version to different content-hosting sites (for example, YouTube and TikTok for videos, Instagram and Twitter for photos, and Twitter for text-only content). Contributors can upload, organize, create text-based content, edit text-based content, and send their final version of the content to reviewers. Reviewers review content, make changes to text-based content, and send it to admins to get published. If a task needs to be redone, they can send it back to contributors with comments on what to fix. Editors must review all content before it is published by administrators. The system will track all published and draft content, as well as all changes made to the content. All users will have the ability to search for and filter all content based on different criteria.
